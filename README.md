This is a simple repository to demo how to use 

    grunt + bower + requirejs + angular

together, and also how to write unit tests and e2e tests for them.

## run unit tests

    karma start karma.conf.js

## run e2e tests

    webdriver-manager start
    npm start
    protractor test/protractor-conf.js
